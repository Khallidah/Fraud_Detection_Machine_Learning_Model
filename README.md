# Fraud_Detection_Machine_Learning_Model
I built a fraud detection model for online payment platforms using a machine learning approach to identify and prevent fraud. I tested a variety of models and selected the best model for my system. This model is more accurate and efficient than traditional fraud detection methods and it can be used to detect a wider range of fraudulent activities.
